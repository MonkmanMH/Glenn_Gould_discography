# Glenn_Gould_discography

An incomplete discography of the pianist [Glenn Gould](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Gould), with an initial focus on the original editions released by Columbia (later CBS). 

The various sources across the internet are incomplete and/or formatted in a non-tidy way. The long term plan is to add a separate table for each piece of music recorded, and then cross-reference them with later releases (notably the Glenn Gould Edition CD series, released starting in 1992-1997).

The Wikipedia entry "[Glenn Gould discography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Gould_discography)" (to which I have contributed) made a good starting point, but has required significant edits to get it into a tidier structure (e.g. splitting the "Label, serial number" into three columns).
